# 👋 Hi, I’m Kaushal Desai

I’m a **Full-stack Blockchain Engineer** building systems where **code directly controls capital, execution, and coordination**.

I spend most of my time at the intersection of **DeFi infrastructure, restaking (EigenLayer), and AI-driven agents**, working on products that ship to mainnet and operate under real economic constraints.

I like hard problems, unclear specs, and systems where correctness matters more than clever abstractions.

## What I’ve Been Building

### ⚙️ Decentralized Automation (EigenLayer AVS)
I worked on **TriggerX**, a decentralized automation network built on EigenLayer, securing **$2B+ TVR**.  
My focus was designing **Solidity smart contracts**, **Go-based execution engines**, and backend coordination logic for trustless cross-chain task execution.

This meant dealing with failure modes, slashing-aligned incentives, operator coordination, and production reliability.

### 🧰 Developer Tooling
**OmniKit** is an npm-based toolkit I built to make cross-chain smart contract deployment simple and repeatable.  
It enables one-command deployments across multiple EVM chains and is currently used by **500+ developers**.

---

### 🤖 AI + Onchain Execution
With **YieldAgent AI**, I explored how LLMs can translate natural language intent into **verifiable onchain actions**.  
The system integrates AI with **Solana (Rust/Anchor)** to execute DeFi actions safely, abstracting complexity without hiding risk.

---

### 💰 DeFi Protocols
I built **McVault**, a cross-chain **ERC-4626 vault system** that allocates capital across protocols like Renzo, Morpho, and Silo to optimize yield.  
The project placed **3rd at ETHGlobal Superhack 2024** and taught me a lot about accounting, edge cases, and safety-first design.

## How I Think About Engineering

- Real systems fail in production, not in diagrams  
- Safety and clear invariants beat clever optimizations  
- Backend, smart contracts, and UX are one system, not separate layers  
- Small decisions compound quickly when money is involved  

I’m comfortable owning systems end-to-end, making trade-offs, and iterating in production.
